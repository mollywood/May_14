      <h4>A Cajun Restaurant in Spring, TX</h4>

    <p>This delicious gem is a particular treat for me, and one of the more expensive options in the list.  Sit at their huge oval bar if you want to see your gulf oysters on the half shell fresh-shucked by hand.  There are plenty of fabulous cocktail options, but be sure to check out their frozen concoction known as the Swamp Thing.  This boozy delight, a cross between a frozen margarita and a frozen hurricane, is sure to be a crowd pleaser!  Too bad this isn't actually NOLA, or I might take one to go!  For an entree, the Catfish Oppolusas has everything that you could possibly want!  </p>
